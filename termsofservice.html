<h4>

    5. Fees and Payment
</h4>
5.1 - Fees. To the extent  <br>the Stark Lab Services are made <br> available for a fee, Customer <br> agrees to pay all fees in United <br> States Dollars. Stark Lab’s fees  <br>are exclusive of all taxes, <br> and Customer must pay any applicable  <br>sales, use, VAT, GST, excise, <br> withholding, or similar taxes or <br> levies, whether domestic or foreign, other <br> than taxes based on the income  <br>of Stark Lab. Except as expressly <br>provided in this Agreement, payments <br> are non-refundable and  <br>non-creditable and payment <br>obligations non-cancellable. <br>

5.2 - Credit Card Payment Terms.br <br> If Customer has signed up to pay <br> via credit card, Customer shall <br> provide its payment information <br>to Stark Lab or to one of <br>its payment processors.br <br> Customer represents to Stark Lab that is the  <br>authorized user of the card, <br> PIN, key or account associated <br> with that payment instrument, <br> and Customer authorizes Stark <br> Lab to charge its credit card <br> or other payment instrument for <br>any funds or other fees <br> (including transaction and credit <br> card fees) incurred by you <br>in connection with the Stark Lab Services.br <br> In addition, Customer is solely <br> responsible for either (a) <br> enabling auto-recharge on Customer’s <br> payment instrument or (b) <br> ensuring that Customer’s payment <br>instrument has a sufficient positive  <br>balance to cover all fees due. <br> If, for any reason, Customer <br> has a negative balance on its account(s),  <br>then Stark Lab reserves the <br>right to suspend access to <br> the Stark Lab Services. <br>

5.3 - Invoicing Payment Terms. <br>If the corresponding Order Form <br> specifies that Customer is to pay <br> via invoice, Stark Lab shall invoice <br>Customer in accordance with the payment <br> terms set forth in the Order Form. <br>Except as otherwise set forth <br> in an Order Form, Customer  <br>will make all of the undisputed <br> fees hereunder within seven (7)  <br>days of the date of the invoice. <br>If Customer is overdue on any payment <br> of undisputed fees and fails to  <br>pay within ten (10) business days <br> of a written notice, then Stark <br> Lab may assess, and Customer agrees <br>to pay a late fee of either 1.5%  <br>per month, or the maximum amount <br>allowable by applicable law, whichever is less.br <br>

5.4 - Disputes. <br>Customer must notify Stark Lab in <br>writing of any good-faith invoice <br>dispute within twenty (20) days of the  <br>applicable invoice date and  <br>reasonably cooperate with Stark  <br>Lab in resolving any dispute. <br> If the parties are unable to <br> resolve a dispute within ten  <br>(10) days of Customer’s notice, <br> each party will have the right to seek <br> any remedies it may have under  <br>this Agreement, at law or in equity, <br> irrespective of any provision in <br>this Agreement that would limit  <br>seeking these remedies on account  <br>of a payment dispute. For clarity, any <br>undisputed amounts must be paid <br> in full in accordance with this Section <br>.

<h4>

    6. Term and Termination
</h4>
6.1 - Term. <br> This Agreement is effective as of <br> the Effective Date and continues <br> until terminated. Either party may <br>terminate this Agreement with <br> thirty (30) days’ advance written <br> notice if all Terms for the Stark <br>Lab Service(s) have expired <br> or are terminated as expressly  <br>permitted in this Agreement.br <br>

6.2 - Renewals <br>. By executing an Order Form for <br> purchase of a Stark Lab Service,<br> Customer is agreeing to pay applicable <br> fees for the entire Term <br>. Customer cannot cancel or <br>terminate this Agreement except  <br>as expressly permitted by Section 6.4  <br>(Termination for Cause) and Section <br> 10.1 (Limited Warranty). If no start  <br>date is specified on the applicable <br>Order Form, the Term starts when <br> Customer first obtains access  <br>to the Stark Lab Service. Each <br>Term will automatically renew  <br>for additional successive renewal <br>terms with the same length as the <br> initial term unless: (i) <br>otherwise stated on the applicable  <br>Order Form; or <br> (ii) either party gives written notice <br>of non-renewal at least thirty <br>(30) days before the end of the then-current <Term class="br"></Term> <br>

6.3 - Suspension of Service. <br> Stark Lab may suspend Customer’s access <br> to the Stark Lab Service(s) <br> if Customer’s account is overdue <br>and Customer fails to pay amounts <br> due within ten (10) days of notice <br>by Stark Lab, subject to Section <br> 5.4 (Disputes). <br> Stark Lab may also suspend Customer’s <br>access to the Stark Lab Service(s) <br> if it determines that suspension <br> is necessary to prevent harm or <br> liability to other customers or third <br>parties, or to preserve the  <br>security, stability, availability or <br>integrity of the Stark Lab Service. <br>

6.4 - Termination for Cause. <br> Either party may terminate this Agreement, <br> including any related Order Form, if  <br>the other party: (i) fails to cure any material <br>breach of this Agreement (including  <br>a failure to pay undisputed fees) within thirty (30) <br> days after written notice detailing <br> the breach; (ii) ceases operation  <br>without a successor; or (iii)  <br>if permitted by applicable law,  <br>seeks protection under any bankruptcy, <br> receivership, trust deed, creditors’ <br> arrangement, composition, or comparable <br> proceeding, or if any of these proceedings <br> are instituted against that party <br>(and not dismissed within sixty  <br>(60) days thereafter). <br>

6.5 - Effect of Termination. <br>Upon any expiration or termination <br>of this Agreement or an Order <br> Form, Customer’s license rights  <br>terminate and it must promptly: <br> (a) stop using the applicable Stark  <br>Lab Service(s) (including any related <br> Stark Lab Technology); <br> (b) delete (or, at Stark <br>Lab’s request, return) any and <br>all copies of the Stark Lab Code, <br> any Stark Lab documentation, <br>passwords or access codes,<br> and any other Stark Lab Confidential <br> Information in Customer’s possession <br>, custody, or control. If Stark <br> Lab terminates this Agreement for cause  <br>as provided in Section 6.4  <br>(Termination for Cause), any payments <br> for the remaining portion of  <br>the Term will become due and  <br>must be paid immediately by <br>Customer. If Customer terminates this Agreement <br>for cause as provided in Section <br> 6.4 (Termination for Cause), <br> Customer will receive a refund of any fees <br> it has pre-paid for the <br>terminated portion of the applicable <br> Term. Except where this Agreement specifies <br> an exclusive remedy, all remedies  <br>under this Agreement, including termination <br> or suspension, are  <br> and not exclusive of any other <br> rights or remedies that may be <br> available to a party. <br>

    7. Confidential Information

</h4>
7.1 - Confidentiality Obligation <br>. Each party (as the receiving party) <br> must: (i) hold in confidence and not <br> disclose the other party’s  <br>Confidential Information to  <br>third parties except as permitted  <br>by this Agreement; and (ii) only <br> use the other party’s Confidential <br> Information to fulfill <br> its obligations and exercise its <br> rights under this Agreement <br> . Each party may share the <br>other party’s Confidential  <br>Information with its employees, <br> agents or contractors having  <br>a legitimate need to know <br> (which, for Stark Lab, includes the  <br>subcontractors referenced in Section  <br>12.4), provided that the party  <br>remains responsible for any recipient’s <br>compliance with the terms <br> of this Section 7 and that these <br> recipients are bound to confidentiality <br>obligations no less protective <br> than this Section. <br>


<h4>

    8. Stark Lab Technology
</h4>
8.1 - Ownership and Updates. <br> This is a term-limited <br>agreement for access to <br>and use of the Stark Lab <br>Service. Customer acknowledges <br>that it is obtaining only a limited <br> right to use the Stark Lab <br>Service and no ownership rights are <br> transferred to Customer under <br> this Agreement. Stark Lab <br> (or its suppliers) retain all rights,<br> title and interest (including <br>all intellectual property rights) <br> in and to all Stark Lab Technology, <br> which is deemed Stark Lab’s <br>Confidential Information, <br> and reserves any licenses not  <br>specifically granted in this <br> Agreement. Other than the Stark <br>Lab Code, the Stark Lab  <br>Service is offered as an online, <br> hosted product. Accordingly,  <br>Customer acknowledges and agrees <br> that it has no right to obtain <br> a copy of the software behind  <br>any Stark Lab Service. In addition, <br>Stark Lab may collect learnings, <br> logs, and data regarding the <br> performance and use of the  <br>Stark Lab Service, and that  <br>Stark Lab may make updates, bug fixes, <br> modifications or improvements  <br>to the Stark Lab Service from time-to-time. <br>

<h4>

    9. Indemnification
</h4>

Customer agrees to defend Stark <br>Lab from and against any  <br>third-party claim to the extent <br>resulting from any Customer Properties, <br> its negligence, willful misconduct <br> or breach of this Agreement. <br>Customer will indemnify and hold Stark  <br>Lab harmless from and against any  <br>damages and costs awarded against <br> Stark Lab or agreed in settlement by  <br>Customer (including reasonable attorney’s <br> fees) that result from these <br> third-party claims. Customer must not <br> settle any claim without Stark <br> Lab’s prior written consent  <br>if the settlement would require Stark <br> Lab to admit fault, pay amounts <br> that Customer must pay under this <br> Agreement, or take or refrain from taking any <br> action. Stark Lab may participate <br> in a claim through counsel  <br> its own choosing at its own expense  <br>and Customer and Stark Lab  <br>will reasonably cooperate on the defense. <br>

<h4>

    10. Disclaimers
</h4>
ALL STARK LAB TECHNOLOGY AND <br> RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED  <br>“AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” <br>BASIS. NEITHER STARK LAB NOR ITS  <br>SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, <br> EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR  <br>OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO  <br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, <br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, <br> OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

CUSTOMER MAY  <br>HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER,  <br>ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES <br> UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, WILL <br>BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM  <br>EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

<h4>

    11. Limitations of Liability
</h4>
11.1 - Consequential Damages Waiver.  <br>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED  <br>BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER  <br>PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS  <br>OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA,  <br> OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, <br> REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT,  <br> SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE <br> OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND  <br>HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED <br> IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF <br> THESE DAMAGES. <br>


11.2 - Liability Cap.  <br>STARK LAB’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL <br>NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT <br> ACTUALLY PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER <br>TO STARK LAB FOR THE APPLICABLE <br> STARK LAB SERVICE OR RELATED SERVICES <br> IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING <br> THE CLAIM, EXCEPT THAT THIS SECTION <br> 11.2 DOES NOT APPLY TO: (i) DEFENSE <br> COSTS AND DAMAGES PAYABLE BY AN  <br>INDEMNIFYING PARTY TO THIRD PARTIES <br> UNDER SECTION 9 (INDEMNIFICATION); AND (ii) <br> CUSTOMER’S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AS  <br>EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  <br>FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA <br> RELEASES, STARK LAB’S TOTAL LIABILITY <br>WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S.  <br>DOLLARS ($50 US). <br>
